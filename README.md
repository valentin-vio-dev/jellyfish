Jellyfish allows you to record, process and visualize EEG signals on your smartphone. The application is implemented with Ionic and Angular frameworks, so it can be used under both Android and iOS operating systems. It can be used primarily with Emotiv devices (EPOC + and Insight), however, compatibility with other product families is also planned in the future. The EEG device is connected to the phone via Bluetooth communication, which enables accurate and fast data transfer within a certain range. The data is stored in the cloud, ensuring that other users are free to use the data in different projects anywhere in the world.
